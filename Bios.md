### 3rd person

Tania is a Research Software Engineer at heart. She has worked with multiple research groups within the UK, Europe and America to develop sustainable, reproducible, and robust scientific software.
Her main focus is complex analysis workflows, scalable data science, and reproducibility and replicability in scientific computing. She contributes to a number of open source projects and is a very active member of the FOSS and data science community. Apart from her academic duties she enjoys working on community building projects as well as in projects and initiatives aimed to increase the diversity and inclusivity in scientific computing and STEM areas in general.

### SSI Profile

I am a Research Software Engineer at the University of Sheffield. Before this I had conducted research on control systems for implantable drug delivery devices and completed a PhD in computational materials science at the University of Sheffield. During the course of my PhD I became aware of the importance of developing open and sustainable scientific software as well as of the needs for reproducibility guidelines and incentives in computationally intensive scientific areas. As such I became an advocate for software development best practices and open software and data.

As a RSE I work with a number of researchers working on computationally intensive research projects, either at the early stages (e.g. designing their data collection and curation strategies and software requirements) or during the later stages in their projects (e.g. code optimisation, packaging).
Working as an RSE means that I am often involved in the creation of new software as well as developing novel techniques or approaches to improve or modify existing applications.
In addition to developing, testing, and maintaining software I also advise researchers on ways to make the most of their code and to maximise the impact of their research. I am also involved in the analysis of large, complex, data sets from a number of disciplines.

I am also very passionate about teaching and mentoring. I co-organise a number of software development and software best practices workshops across the university. I also run and lead additional coding workshops / programmes mainly serving underrepresented groups in our community. I am also involved in a number of initiatives around data and technology for social good. I also contribute  to a number of open source projects (and I love the open source community)!

I take an interest in policy areas fair representation and inclusion in STEM areas and promoting collaboration and knowledge sharing.
